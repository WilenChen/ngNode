You can also go through this [StackOverflow Thread](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8144214/learning-express-for-node-js) for more resources.\n* AngularJS - Angular's [Official Website](http://angularjs.org/) is a great starting point. You can also use [Thinkster Popular Guide](http://www.thinkster.io/), and the [Egghead Videos](https://egghead.io/).\n* Node.js - Start by going through [Node.js Official Website](http://nodejs.org/) and this [StackOverflow Thread](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2353818/how-do-i-get-started-with-node-js), which should get you going with the Node.js platform in no time.\n\n##Usages\ndependencies:\n```javascript\n\"ngNode\" : \"^1.0.1\"\n```\nmake a config object and call lib as function directly\n```javascript\nvar config = {\n\tappName : \"testapp\",\n\tmongodConnection : \"mongodb://localhost:27017/ngnode\",\n\tmodelConfig : [\n    // custom model config object\n\t]\n};\nrequire(\"ngNode\")(config);\n```\nvisit in chrome: http://localhost:9527/user\n\n\n\n",
